# Changelog

## Develop

- Change license year to 2022
- MQTT: Improve module implementation
- MQTT: Add optional SSL connection type
- MQTT: Add cayenne async demo, publish-mode only through ring buffer
- MQTT CAYENNE: Completely reworked with asynchronous MQTT instead. Improves performance to transmit more data in one shot
- MQTT client: Add poll periodic event for event callback
- Port: Improve ThreadX port
- CONN: Enable manual TCP receive by default, to improve system stability
- Timeout: module returns ERRMEM if no memory to allocate block
- Add esp_at_binaries from Espressif, used for library verification (official AT firmware)
- Add optional `AT+CMD?` command at reset/restore process, for debug purpose for the moment, only
- Add function to get ESP device used for AT command communication
- Fix `lwesp_get_min_at_fw_version` to return min AT version for detected ESP device
- SNTP: Improve module comments, change timezone variable to `int16_t`
- SNTP: Implement global callback when command is to obtain current time
- SNTP: Add synchronization interval config, available with ESP AT `2.3.0` or later (ESP32-C3 only for the moment)
- ERR: Add option to get response to `ERR CODE:` message if command doesn't exist and put it to result of command execution
- Fix min at version for ESP32 to `2.2.0`
- Add `LWESP ` prefix for debug messages
- Update code style with astyle
- Add `.clang-format` draft - remove astyle support
- SSL: Added experimental support
- FileSystem: Added support for erase and write operation
- Code improvement: Change multiple local variables to single structure
- Delete `lwesp_datetime_t` and use generic `struct tm` instead
- Conn and netconn: Add validation counter to ensure netconn object matches connection object and that there was no connection close/re-open in between
- Minimum supported AT version is now `v3.2.0 (ESP32, ESP32-C3)` to support new MFG write operations
- SYSFLASH: Split System flash and Manufacturing data to separate commands, following new breaking changes for ESP-AT firmware

## 1.1.2-dev

- Add POSIX-compliant low-level driver (thanks to community to implement it)
- Prohibit transmission of too long UDP packets (default), can be disabled with configuration option
- Split CMakeLists.txt files between library and executable
- Move `esp_set_server` function to separate file `lwesp_server.c`
- Use `AT+GMR` command just after reset/restore to determine ESP device being connected on AT port
- Minimum required AT binaries are now `2.3.0` for `ESP32/ESP32C3` and `2.2.1` for `ESP8266`
- Connection status is acquired with `AT+CIPSTATE` or `AT+CIPSTATUS`, depends on Espressif connected device
- Add optional full fields for access point scan with `LWESP_CFG_ACCESS_POINT_STRUCT_FULL_FIELDS` config option
- Add optional keep-alive periodic timeout to system event callback functions. Can be used to act as generic timeout event
- Improve station manager snippet with asynchronous mode
