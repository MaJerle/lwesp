# Lightweight ESP-AT parser

LwESP is lightweight ESP AT commands parser library to communicate with ESP8266 or ESP32 Wi-Fi modules using AT commands.
Module is written in C99 and is system platform agnostic. Its main targets are embedded system devices like ARM Cortex-M, AVR, PIC and others, but can easily work under `Windows`, `Linux` or `MAC` environments too.

Espressif module runs official [AT Commands (esp-at)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-at) software and communicates with host device via UART or SPI communication protocol.

Follow documentation for more information on implementation and details.
